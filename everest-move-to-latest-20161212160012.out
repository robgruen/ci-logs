I don't see any fstar.exe or krml in your path; add /cygdrive/c/Build/Agent/_work/31/s/FStar/bin and /cygdrive/c/Build/Agent/_work/31/s/kremlin to your PATH via ~/.bashrc? [Yn]
Skipping ~/.bashrc customization because EVEREST_CI is set
... fstar.exe and krml in PATH
FSTAR_HOME is not set... set it? [Yn]
Skipping ~/.bashrc customization because EVEREST_CI is set
... FSTAR_HOME ok

Remember to run source ~/.bashrc if it was modified!
